UPDATE I:

I added a testing index file (and some music for
some stupid idea) about 4 months ago, but I have
now deleted everything as I have started to
develop an entirely different website. The original
was supposed to be inspired by a 2001 version of
planethalflife.com - now I'm making a new one
that isn't really inspired by a website per se,
but if I had to credit one, it would probably be
every single website from between the years of
1998-2011. So, I guess it is original to some
degree.

I don't remember why I had added music, nor do
I know if I'll add it again, but we'll see.

I hope you enjoy this site - since it's now
public, we can refer to this as Website I or
John F's Website: First Edition.

Editions will only change based on style changes.

Alright, enjoy!

Hello source code explorer! This is the source code for
my website. I've uploaded it here as I know some people are
curious about website code, and I don't want them to deal
with the mess that is the source viewer of inspect element.
Here on GitHub, not only is everything organized, but you
can also see what languages were used for this and the
percentage rate of it, which is pretty cool.

If you want to contact me for whatever reason,
you can reach out by email:

Thanks for visiting!
